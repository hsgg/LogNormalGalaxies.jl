In this directory we generate some documentation.

The LaTeX file is in `tex/lognormal.tex`.

Plots are generated by scripts in `scripts/`. They may depend on files first
calculated, also by scripts in `scripts/`. These scripts use configuration
files that are generated by `scripts/gen_configs.jl`.

In order to put it all together, first run `scripts/gen_configs.jl`, then
`make` or `make -j4`. Be careful how many jobs you run in parallel.
